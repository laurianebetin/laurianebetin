							<a href="https://www.lecolededesign.com/" target='_blank' class='inline__link'> L’École de design Nantes Atlantique </a> was the school where I did my Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees. To complete the latter, I worked for almost ten months on my end-of-studies project and thesis. Having lived in Brittany for most of my life and being surrounded by the sea, I chose to focus on wind and its impact on our lives. The city that I studied in this research was Lesconil, a little town part of the Plobannalec-Lesconil municipality in Brittany. I chose Lesconil because it is particularly exposed to south-western winds coming from the Atlantic. This end-of-studies project allowed me to step outside of my comfort zone by interviewing habitants, creating design tools to better understand their knowledge of the winds, finding experts and asking them questions, and reading a lot of articles to become imbued with my topic.

						In today’s world, storms are more and more violent, but are people aware of this? What do they do to be resilient? How do they act when a storm is coming? And when it is hitting? My reading and interviews with experts allowed me to expose some important facts:
					</p>
					<ul class="main__list mid__width">
						<li>
							Storms are more violent because of climate change.
						</li>
						<li>
							They are very hard to forecast, hence their dangerousness.
						</li>
						<li>
							Middle latitudes (where France is located) are more exposed to violent winds.
						</li>
						<li>
							Brittany is a particularly exposed area because of the south west winds coming from the Atlantic, so its coastlines are very fragile and subject to erosion and flooding.
						</li>
						<li>
							Lesconil is one of the most exposed zones of Brittany (not including the islands) because it is located in the south with no direct obstacles. Moreover,due to it being a popular tourist destination, people need to be aware of storms and its dangers.

It also has different beaches on both sides of the port, and different promenades are available to visit the coastlines and surrounding areas. Due to its southern coastlines, Lesconil is often exposed to violent winds coming from the south-west.

In Lesconil, I talked to roughly twenty local people, but also the tourist office, the Mayor of Lesconil, the town hall urbanist, the sailing center, and local bars and restaurants. Furthermore, I interviewed people outside of Lesconil, to gather tourist and expert opinions. I created a survey for the tourists and spoke to  some experts, like geographers, CNRS (translation: Scientific Research National Center) research workers, geologists, architects, designers and developers. After gathering a variety of information, I organised it and kept what was the most important. You will see some examples below of my discoveries and the conclusions that I derived.

I created thirteen cards with numbers going from 0 to 12, representing the thirteen different wind categories, and I did the same for the names of the winds, their speeds, and their impact on the sea and land. When I interviewed users, I drew one wind name and they had to find the four related cards.

						<li>
							Three types of people: permanent residents, seasonal inhabitants and casual tourists. Permanent residents feel that they know the winds, but it has changed over the years and they might not be all aware of it. Seasonal inhabitants are increasing every year and most of them are less aware of the winds and its consequences.
						</li>
						<li>
							People have issues visualizing and understanding the Beaufort scale, so they don’t understand the potential dangers.
						</li>
						<li>
							People minimize the risks and exhibit the wrong behaviour when reacting to a crisis.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fascination with these risks makes it even more dangerous.

						Explore, create and iterate on designs,n and conceive three distinct concepts. This second phase was in the form of posters, one to summarize the first phase and one for each concept. Additionally, I had to conceive small models for each concept. It was also allowed to display booklets and other useful artifacts: I displayed my card game, a map booklet and a technical drawing details booklet. Because we were not allowed to defend our work in person, and the jury only allocated ten minutes per student, everything had to be concise and accurate. During this second phase, I also kept interviewing users and new experts, asking them their opinion on my ideas.

Built in 1804, it used to warn sailors of strong gales, and it proved its sustainability. Renovated in 2000 by the city hall to create offices, it was turned into an exhibition hall in 2010.

						The refuge is made for 14 people. Storms usually strike during the winter, when there are not so many people around in Lesconil. If it happens during the summer, the most fragile people can be moved here while the others will have to wait for the firefighter to take them to the sports club a few kilometers away - as is the current response to storms. People will have a manual at their disposal to show them how to use the space. I created a bathroom and kitchen area in the former offices which can be hidden to the public using sliding panels. Those seeking refuge will have everything that they need, and they can get privacy using integrated curtains for the beds and customizable panels in the bathroom. The Wind Universe room can be used as a social space, while the other room can serve as a dining and sleeping area.
